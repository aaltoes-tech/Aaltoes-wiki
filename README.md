# Aaltoes Wiki

## Project Overview

The **Aaltoes Wiki** project aims to create **wiki.aaltoes.com**, a comprehensive knowledge hub where we will document:
- **Past Aaltoes Projects**: A historical archive of initiatives, events, and startup stories from the Aaltoes community.
- **Startup Creation Resources**: Information on legal aspects, business registration, funding, and scaling a startup.
- **Open Source Development Guide**: Best practices for launching and maintaining open-source projects, including licensing, tools, and community-building strategies.

## Project Status
This project is currently in its early planning phase. **No framework has been chosen yet**, and we are actively seeking **collaborators, developers, and contributors** who are interested in shaping the foundation of this knowledge hub.

## How to Get Involved
We are looking for:
- Developers to help build the infrastructure.
- Writers to contribute to documentation and knowledge-sharing.
- Legal experts to provide guidance on startup-related legal aspects.
- Open-source advocates to ensure best practices in licensing and collaboration.

## Next Steps
